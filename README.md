Project from this [source](https://vqhuy.github.io/teaching/linux/project).

## Usage of the script

First you need to import this :

```py
import socket
import os
import sys
import subprocess
```

In this repository, you find my reports which explain the code (even if I have some block comments in my script .py) and some example of code necessary for the project.
